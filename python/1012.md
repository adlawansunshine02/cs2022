# [Python Lists](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_lists.asp)

- List
  - Lists are used to store multiple items in a single variable.
  - Lists are one of 4 built-in data types in Python used to store collections of data, the other 3 are Tuple, Set, and Dictionary, all with different qualities and usage.
  - Lists are created using square brackets:
``` python
print("高瑞夫 - 4110e233")
thislist = ["pineapple", "watermelon", "strawberry"]
print(thislist)
```
  - List Items
    - List items are ordered, changeable, and allow duplicate values.
    - List items are indexed, the first item has index `[0]`, the second item has index `[1]` etc.

  - Ordered
    - When we say that lists are ordered, it means that the items have a defined order, and that order will not change.
    - If you add new items to a list, the new items will be placed at the end of the list.

Note: There are some list methods that will change the order, but in general: the order of the items will not change.

  - Changeable
    - The list is changeable, meaning that we can change, add, and remove items in a list after it has been created.

  - Allow Duplicates
    - Since lists are indexed, lists can have items with the same value:
``` python
print("高瑞夫 - 4110e233")
thislist = ["pineapple", "watermelon", "strawberry", "strawberry", "strawberry"]
print(thislist)
```

  - List Length
    - To determine how many items a list has, use the `len()` function:
``` python
print("高瑞夫 - 4110e233")
thislist = ["pineapple", "watermelon", "strawberry"]
print(len(thislist)) 
```

  - List Items - Data Types
    - List items can be of any data type:
``` python
print("高瑞夫 - 4110e233")
string_list = ["pineapple", "watermelon", "strawberry"]
int_list = [1, 5, 7, 9, 3]
bolean_list = [True, False, False]

print(string_list)
print(int_list)
print(bolean_list)
```
    - A list can contain different data types:
``` python
print("高瑞夫 - 4110e233")
list = [100, "HELLO", 99, True, False]

print(list)
```

  - type()
    - From Python's perspective, lists are defined as objects with the data type 'list':
`<class 'list'>`
``` python
print("高瑞夫 - 4110e233")
mylist = ["pineapple", "watermelon", "strawberry"]
print(type(mylist))
```

``` python
print("高瑞夫 - 4110e233")
 
```

``` python
print("高瑞夫 - 4110e233")
 
```

``` python
print("高瑞夫 - 4110e233")
 
```
