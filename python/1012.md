# [Python Lists](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_lists.asp)

- List
  - Lists are used to store multiple items in a single variable.
  - Lists are one of 4 built-in data types in Python used to store collections of data, the other 3 are Tuple, Set, and Dictionary, all with different qualities and usage.
  - Lists are created using square brackets:
``` python
print("高瑞夫 - 4110e233")
thislist = ["pineapple", "strawberry", "watermelon"]
print(thislist)
```
- List Items
  - List items are ordered, changeable, and allow duplicate values.
  - List items are indexed, the first item has index `[0]`, the second item has index `[1]` etc.

- Ordered
  - When we say that lists are ordered, it means that the items have a defined order, and that order will not change.
  - If you add new items to a list, the new items will be placed at the end of the list.

Note: There are some list methods that will change the order, but in general: the order of the items will not change.

- Changeable
  - The list is changeable, meaning that we can change, add, and remove items in a list after it has been created.

- Allow Duplicates
  - Since lists are indexed, lists can have items with the same value:
``` python
print("高瑞夫 - 4110e233")
thislist = ["pineapple", "strawberry", "watermelon", "strawberry", "strawberry"]
print(thislist)
```

- List Length
  - To determine how many items a list has, use the `len()` function:
``` python
print("高瑞夫 - 4110e233")
thislist = ["pineapple", "strawberry", "watermelon"]
print(len(thislist)) 
```

- List Items - Data Types
  - List items can be of any data type:
``` python
print("高瑞夫 - 4110e233")
string_list = ["pineapple", "strawberry", "watermelon"]
int_list = [1, 5, 7, 9, 3]
bolean_list = [True, False, False]

print(string_list)
print(int_list)
print(bolean_list)
```
  - A list can contain different data types:
``` python
print("高瑞夫 - 4110e233")
list = [100, "HELLO", 99, True, False]

print(list)
```

- type()
    - From Python's perspective, lists are defined as objects with the data type 'list':

<class 'list'>

``` python
print("高瑞夫 - 4110e233")
mylist = ["pineapple", "strawberry", "watermelon"]
print(type(mylist))
```

# [Access List Items](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_lists_access.asp)

- Access Items
  - List items are indexed and you can access them by referring to the index number:
``` python
print("高瑞夫 - 4110e233")
thislist = ["pineapple", "strawberry", "watermelon"]
print(thislist[2])
```
Note: The first item has index 0.

- Negative Indexing
    - Negative indexing means start from the end
    - `-1` refers to the last item, `-2` refers to the second last item etc.
``` python
print("高瑞夫 - 4110e233")
thislist = ["pineapple", "strawberry", "watermelon"]
print(thislist[-2])
```

- Range of Indexes
    - You can specify a range of indexes by specifying where to start and where to end the range.
    - When specifying a range, the return value will be a new list with the specified items.
``` python
print("高瑞夫 - 4110e233")
thislist = ["pineapple", "strawberry", "watermelon", "wine", "xerox", "zebra"]
print(thislist[1:4])
```
Note: The search will start at index 2 (included) and end at index 5 (not included).

Remember that the first item has index 0.

- By leaving out the start value, the range will start at the first item:
``` python
print("高瑞夫 - 4110e233")
thislist = ["pineapple", "strawberry", "watermelon", "wine", "xerox", "zebra"]
print(thislist[:6])
```
- By leaving out the end value, the range will go on to the end of the list:
``` python
print("高瑞夫 - 4110e233")
thislist = ["pineapple", "strawberry", "watermelon", "wine", "xerox", "zebra"]
print(thislist[1:])
```

- Range of Negative Indexes
  - Specify negative indexes if you want to start the search from the end of the list:
``` python
print("高瑞夫 - 4110e233")
thislist = ["pineapple", "strawberry", "watermelon", "wine", "xerox", "zebra"]
print(thislist[-6:-2])
```

- Check if Item Exists
    - To determine if a specified item is present in a list use the in keyword:
``` python
print("高瑞夫 - 4110e233")
thislist = ["pineapple", "strawberry", "watermelon"]
if "strawberry" in thislist:
  print("Yes, 'strawberry' is in the list")
```

``` python
print("高瑞夫 - 4110e233")

```

``` python
print("高瑞夫 - 4110e233")

```

``` python
print("高瑞夫 - 4110e233")

```

``` python
print("高瑞夫 - 4110e233")

```
