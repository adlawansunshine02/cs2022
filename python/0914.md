#[Python Dictionaries](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_dictionaries.asp)

- Dictionary
  - Dictionaries are used to store data values in key:value pairs.
  - A dictionary is a collection which is ordered*, changeable and do not allow duplicates.

As of Python version 3.7, dictionaries are ordered. In Python 3.6 and earlier, dictionaries are unordered.

  - Dictionaries are written with curly brackets, and have keys and values:
``` python
print("高瑞夫 - 4110e233")
thisdict = {
  "School": "KSU",
  "Country": "Taiwan",
  "year": 2022
}
print(thisdict)
```

- Dictionary Items
    - Dictionary items are ordered, changeable, and does not allow duplicates.
    - Dictionary items are presented in key:value pairs, and can be referred to by using the key name.
``` python
print("高瑞夫 - 4110e233")
thisdict = {
  "School": "KSU",
  "Country": "Taiwan",
  "year": 2022
}
print(thisdict["year"])
```

- Ordered or Unordered?
    - As of Python version 3.7, dictionaries are ordered. In Python 3.6 and earlier, dictionaries are unordered.
    - When we say that dictionaries are ordered, it means that the items have a defined order, and that order will not change.
    - Unordered means that the items does not have a defined order, you cannot refer to an item by using an index.

- Changeable
    - Dictionaries are changeable, meaning that we can change, add or remove items after the dictionary has been created.

- Duplicates Not Allowed
    - Dictionaries cannot have two items with the same key:
``` python
print("高瑞夫 - 4110e233")
thisdict = {
  "School": "KSU",
  "Country": "Taiwan",
  "year": 2022,
  "year": 2023
}
print(thisdict)
```

- Dictionary Length
    - To determine how many items a dictionary has, use the `len()` function:
``` python
print("高瑞夫 - 4110e233")
thisdict = {
  "School": "KSU",
  "Country": "Taiwan",
  "year": 2022
}
print(len(thisdict))
```

- Dictionary Items - Data Types
    - The values in dictionary items can be of any data type:
``` python
print("高瑞夫 - 4110e233")
thisdict = {
  "string": "reeyyybb",
  "int": 1,
  "boolean": True,
  "list": ["reeeyyybb", 1, True]
}
print(thisdict)
```

- type()
    - From Python's perspective, dictionaries are defined as objects with the data type 'dict':

<class 'dict'>

``` python
print("高瑞夫 - 4110e233")
thisdict = {
  "School": "KSU",
  "Country": "Taiwan",
  "year": 2022
}
print(type(thisdict))
```
#[Access Dictionary Items](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_dictionaries_access.asp)

- Accessing Items
    - You can access the items of a dictionary by referring to its key name, inside square brackets:
``` python
print("高瑞夫 - 4110e233")
thisdict = {
  "School": "KSU",
  "Country": "Taiwan",
  "year": 2022
}
print(thisdict["Country"])
```
  - There is also a method called `get()` that will give you the same result:
``` python
print("高瑞夫 - 4110e233")
thisdict = {
  "School": "KSU",
  "Country": "Taiwan",
  "year": 2022
}
print(thisdict.get("Country"))
```

- Get Keys
  - The `keys()` method will return a list of all the keys in the dictionary.
- Get Values
  - The `values()` method will return a list of all the values in the dictionary.
- Get Items
  - The items() method will return each item in a dictionary, as tuples in a list.
``` python
print("高瑞夫 - 4110e233")
thisdict = {
  "School": "KSU",
  "Country": "Taiwan",
  "year": 2022
}
#before
print(thisdict.keys()) #get keys
print(thisdict.values()) #get values
print(thisdict.items()) #get items

thisdict["MyName"] = "reeeyyybb"

#after
print(thisdict.keys())
print(thisdict.values())
print(thisdict.items()) #before change

thisdict["year"] = "2023"

print(thisdict.items()) #after change
```
- Check if Key Exists
    - To determine if a specified key is present in a dictionary use the `in` keyword:
``` python
print("高瑞夫 - 4110e233")
thisdict = {
  "School": "KSU",
  "Country": "Taiwan",
  "year": 2022
}
if "Country" in thisdict:
  print("Yes, 'country' is one of the keys in the thisdict dictionary")
```

``` python
print("高瑞夫 - 4110e233")

```

``` python
print("高瑞夫 - 4110e233")

```

``` python
print("高瑞夫 - 4110e233")

```

``` python
print("高瑞夫 - 4110e233")

```


``` python
print("高瑞夫 - 4110e233")

```


``` python
print("高瑞夫 - 4110e233")

```

``` python
print("高瑞夫 - 4110e233")

```


``` python
print("高瑞夫 - 4110e233")

```

``` python
print("高瑞夫 - 4110e233")

```

``` python
print("高瑞夫 - 4110e233")

```

``` python
print("高瑞夫 - 4110e233")

```
``` python
print("高瑞夫 - 4110e233")

```
``` python
print("高瑞夫 - 4110e233")

```

``` python
print("高瑞夫 - 4110e233")

```

``` python
print("高瑞夫 - 4110e233")

```

``` python
print("高瑞夫 - 4110e233")

```

``` python
print("高瑞夫 - 4110e233")

```
``` python
print("高瑞夫 - 4110e233")

```
