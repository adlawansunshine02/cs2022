# [Python Strings](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_strings.asp)

- Strings
- Strings in python are surrounded by either single quotation marks, or double quotation marks.
``` python
print("Good day")
print('wazzup')
# You can display a string literal with the print() function
```

- Assign String to a Variable
- Assigning a string to a variable is done with the variable name followed by an equal sign and the string
``` python
a = "hiyow"
print(a)
```
- Multiline Strings
- You can assign a multiline string to a variable by using three quotes
``` python
a = """Ako'y may tula
mahabang mahaba.
Ako'y uupo
tapos na po."""
print(a)
```

- Strings are Arrays
- strings in Python are arrays of bytes representing `unicode` characters.
``` python
a = "Nin hao, 高瑞夫"
print(a[10])
